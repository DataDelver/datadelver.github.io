## Entering the Labyrinth

Welcome to my blog data delver! I'm so glad you found your way here!  If you're like me, when you first started out with data science and machine learning, you may have been feeling overwhelmed. With so many different concepts to learn it may have seemed as if there was an insurmountable labyrinth of information ahead of you, with no clear path towards mastery and practical application.  Fear not! For you have found a resource which shall aid you in your own quest to navigate the maze.

### Purpose of this Blog

The purpose of this blog is to document my own "delves" into this labyrinth and any resulting knowldege I have unearthed. I plan to focus on a range of topcis, from general software engineering to data science, machine learning engineering, and MLOps, pulling from a range of experiences across my own career as a machine learning engineer and data scientist with a focus on practical, grounded application in industry following best practice.

### Who am I?

My name is Chase Greco, I'm currently a machine learning engineer with 5+ years of industry experince. I love exploring all things machine learning with a particular emphasis on practical application and "making things real". When I'm not writing code, I enjoy swing dancing, reading, and playing video games.
