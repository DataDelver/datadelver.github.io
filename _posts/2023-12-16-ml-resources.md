## My Go To List of Machine Learning Resources

I have often been asked what resources I recommend for those looking to get into machine learning, whether you want to be a data scientist or ml engineer. I this brief delve I'll cover my go to list of resources I continue to rely on whenever I need to refresh my own knowledge or delve deeper into a specific subject matter.

### Books

I have found that books are an excellent way for me to absorb knowledge. I still enjoy having a physical book shelf I can refer to, books I can add sticky notes and my own scribbles in, and physical copies I can lend out to others to read. If you enjoy learning from books, these are my go to list in no particular order:

* [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/) by Aurélien Géron - This is easily the best reference book I have come across for learning the basic (and advanced!) concepts of machine learning, equivalent to several semesters of graduate level coursework. The first half of the book covers "classical" methods of machine learning such as linear models, SVM, and trees, while the second half of the book is fully devoted to neural networks. I have run several books clubs using this book and have had great success using it as a reference material whenever I need a refresher on a particular concept. My only minor criticism is that the second half of the book utilizes Tensorflow over PyTorch (where I have seen the industry trending to over the last few years) for implementing neural networks, however all of the concepts are easily transferable between frameworks. 

* [Practical DataOps Delivering Agile Data Science at Scale](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5104-1) by Harvinder Atwal - If you are interested in learning more about the process of utilizing machine learning as part of a product, and the software delivery management best practices involved look no further than this book! Whether you are an individual contributor or the director of several teams, there is something for every practitioner in the ML space. Whenever I join a new organization, this is the first book I recommend to the leadership team to read. I have not found anything else that comes as close to perfectly describing the challenges involved in putting machine learning into products and how to overcome them.

* [Feature Engineering for Machine Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/feature-engineering-for/9781491953235/) by Alice Zheng & Amanda Casari - A more specialized book once you have a grasp of machine learning fundamentals, this book is a great reference for specific feature engineering techniques. Whenever I have a specific type of data, be it numerical, categorical, text, or images, this books has a reference for the appropriate feature engineering techniques available.

* [The Lean Startup](https://theleanstartup.com/book) by Eric Ries - Classic book on how to correctly ideate through an invocation cycle, find out what works, and pivot when needed. Not specifically an ML book, however its concepts of trying new ideas, measuring their impact, and adjusting are just as applicable when testing out new ML models.
