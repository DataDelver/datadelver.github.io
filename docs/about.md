Welcome to my blog data delver! I'm so glad you found your way here! 
My name is Chase Greco, I'm currently a machine learning engineer with 5+ years of industry experience. 
I love exploring all things machine learning with a particular emphasis on practical application and "making things real".
I started this blog to document my own "delves" into the labyrinth of of Data Science, Machine Learning, and MLOps along with any resulting knowledge I have unearthed.
