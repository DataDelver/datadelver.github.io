# Delve 18: Challenges of AI in Industry

## A Challenge

"What are the biggest challenges you've faced when integrating AI into your work?"

Greetings data delvers! I had the opportunity to serve on a multi-disciplinary panel recently where I was asked that very question. At the time, my answer focused on immediate challenges with the data and access to tooling and while those are legitimate concerns, the question has stuck with me for the past week as requiring a deeper answer. As I've been thinking more about it, I think I've developed a more nuanced view which I'd like to capture here. Hopefully, they may be of use if you are looking to adopt more AI into your workflows!

## The Promise of AI

When AI first emerged into the cultural zeitgeist with the release of ChatGPT a few years ago, I distinctly remember many people heralding it as end of software engineering, that programmers would become "prompt engineers", and that we should stop learning to code because that would be obsolete, yet here we are a few years later, still writing code. Now, it would be naive to state that AI has not transformed software engineering, it absolutely has, but it has not replaced it. It is this relationship of augmentation rather than automation that I think perfectly encapsulates the limits of AI today. There is an often quoted statistic that 80% of AI projects fail, why then do we see continued investment in it? What challenges are enterprising facing that are causing them to fail? Do individuals have anything to learn from these challenges when implementing AI in their own work? What can I do to increase the odds of my project being more successful? These are the questions I'd like to wrangle with today.
